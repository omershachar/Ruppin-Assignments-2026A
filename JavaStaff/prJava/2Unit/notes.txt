- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- UDP (User Diagram Protocol): unsafe protocol
- for reliable information we will use a socket object

- Server: listens on an endless loop to the port where the requests from the client ends up.
- Client: sends request to the server for login (connection request) or for executing a service

Server types:
    - client server: main server that clients approach it directly with requests.
    (e.g. files, games & web server)
    - peer to peer (P2P): clients contact each other directly, both can be simultaneously client & server.
    (e.g. Torrent)

- HTTP (hyper text transfer protocol): Web's application layer protocol
  (HTTP server listens port 80 - WTF)

Total port units of a computer: 65,535 (2^16 = 65,536)
    Why??

Total constructors for Socket - 9? Why?

        try (Socket socket = new Socket("localhost", 5000))
                    -> ("Connected to the server");
- localhost: reserved word that indicates that this computer is the server and the client.
  localhost IP: 127.0.0.1
